Now, we are training for our upcoming match, which we hope to win.” he said.

                                Meanwhile, in the Universities and Colleges Football League, the Varsity’s women’s football side thrashed NYS Vocational Training Institute 3-0 while the provisional team beat Thika School of Medical and Health Sciences 3-1 with the Teams’ Coach Bernard Kitolo noting that the teams have been training intensely and approaching games tactfully to secure victories.
